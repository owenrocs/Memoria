# Memoria

For this game, the following libraries were applied: 'turtle graphics' and 'random'

Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle

The main goals were:
+  Count and print the number of final taps
+  Detect when all the squares have been revealed
+  Center the numbers in each square
  - As an additional point, we can suggest a more effective representation than numbers.
